# Create a Token Using ERC20 on loacal HardHat

This Solidity program is a simple  program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to Create a Token Using ERC20 on loacal HardHat.

## Project: Function Frontend of Smart Contract Management
For this project, create a simple contract with 2-3 functions. Then show the values of those functions in frontend of the application. You can use this starter template to get a head start.

## Description
The files index.js, MySmartContract.sol, and deploy.js contain the necessary code to interact with the smart contract through a front-end interface..

## EXECUTION
After cloning GitHub, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i

2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code.

3. In the second terminal, type: npx hardhat node

4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js (Note: You can also verify the address of deployment in the contractAddress variable in index.js file)

5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the frontend.

After this, the project will be running on your local host, typically at `http://localhost:3000/`.
